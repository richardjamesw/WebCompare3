Extension on WebCompare2.0.

Record connectivity across sites. As a connectivity check, report the number of spanning trees (for any arbitrary node as initial starting point). Store persistently.

Using graph, allow user to select any page, and display graphically the shortest (weighted by any similarity metric) path between that page and the nearest (reachable) cluster center.

Persist data using a custom compression/decompression algorithm.
